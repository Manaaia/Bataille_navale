# Bataille_navale
STILL IN DEVELOPMENT

This is a classical Sea Battle (Bataille navale) game. The app is still in development but is functional.
This project was made for the web and mobile development program at AFPA.

Currently, the app offer the following functionalities:
  - Launch a new game
  - Place your fleet on your grid with drag and drop and rotation on click
  - Play against an AI in a game-turn system by clicking the adverse grid tiles to shoot
  - AI fleet is placed randomly on grid
  - There are sound effects and images for the different cases when firing (missed, hit, sunk)
  - When sunk, the adverse boat becomes visible
  - Endgame
  - Scores
  - Choice of difficulty (beginner, easy)
  
Other developments planned :
  - Two superior levels of difficulty by improving the calculations of AI for firing and placing boats
  - A "Continue game" option
  - A "Play with a friend" option with bluetooth technology
  
I will keep editing this project on my free time, not on a regular basis.
